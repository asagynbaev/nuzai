    "text-1": "AR NFT is our unique development and first step in the grand plan of the Nuzai Network team. This technology allows establishing a linkage between the token’s address contact and the 3D model at the moment when the token’s owner makes a request.",
    "text-2": "Thanks to AR integration into the NTF sphere token owners could interact with tokens using a special wallet app. Therefore, your wallet becomes a curious app letting you see all the details of 3D your model – much better than just an ordinary assets storage. In the closest future, Nuzai Network starts its marketplace and could finally unleash the potential of AR technologies in the NTF world.",
    "text-3": "We use the Binance Smart Chain eco-system, token’s symbol is NZI, NZI – BEP-20, NTF – BEP-721 – the expansion of the most used NFT standard Etherium’s ERC-21, and it’s completely compatible with Etherium Virtual Machine (EVM). By the end of 2022, we are planning to create our blockchain network based on Asynchronous Binary Byzantine Agreement."
